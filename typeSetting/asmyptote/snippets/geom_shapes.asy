The change in composite material response over that with a circular cross-section is compared using their normalised perimeter (shape factor).
For all the considered multi-physical properties and fibre cross-sectional shapes, a novel observation is that the property of interest increases/decrease with the shape factor but with an initial drop/rise.


 
The present work comprehensively examines the influence of fibre-matrix perime-
ter on the multi-physical properties of uni-directional composite materials. Three-
dimensional microstructures, with fibres of triangular, elliptical, rectangular, C-
shape and two-lobe fibre cross-section shapes, are analysed to evaluate effective
thermal conduction, thermo-elastic and piezo-electric properties.

These properties are normalised with the respective properties due to circular shaped fibre cross-section and compared their variation with the normalised fibre cross-section perimeter (shape factor).
For all the considered properties and fibre cross-sectional shapes, a novel observation is that
the property experiences drop (or rise) in the initial range of shape factor but rises (or drops) monotonically afterwards. 

This is in contrast with the existing literature observations,
where properties are understood to have only a monotonic increase/decrease with
the shape factor. Further, it is observed that the magnitude of this drop/rise
is sensitive to the fibre volume fraction and the fibre-matrix property contrast.
In accordance with the literature, a strong correlation is observed between the
in-plane shear moduli, transverse thermal conduction and transverse dielectric
constants
